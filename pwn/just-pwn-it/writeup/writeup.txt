As a no-source, no-binary challenge, the only thing we could do is to keep trying stuff.
We do get something interesting, the first thing we should notice is that the address never changes.
This could mean that PIE, ASLR is not there, so it could be a simple rip overwrite, as advertised.

As we keep trying, we will notice the program crash at some point.
Eventually, we will confirm that the program crashed after 136 bytes.
So it makes sense to assume that the saved rip starts at the 137 byte.

However, if we just supply the leaked address 0x4011e6, it doesn't work.
What could be wrong? Well, at this point, as a pwn player, the 'simplest' thing to try is stack alignment.
If you try this, you win!
