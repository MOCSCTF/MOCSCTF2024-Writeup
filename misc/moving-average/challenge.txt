I just took an investment class and I learnt that one of the techniques to manage buy and sell stocks is by observing simple moving average trend ofstock closing price (https://www.nirmalbang.com/knowledge-center/use-moving-average-for-buying-stocks.html). For example, if the 5 day moving average of stock price becomes higher than it's 10 day moving average we can buy the stock and when the 10 day moving average becomes lower than 5 day moving average then we sell the stock. I got some stock market data about stock 00941 (00941.csv) and I got a "secret card" from the professor of my investment class. Can you help me to verify if I can get profit from this technique?
